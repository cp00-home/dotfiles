# Welcome to my dotfiles

![current desktop](/pictures/desktop.jpg)

Feel free to copy whatever you like from my current setup. I spend some time to make everything look coherent, so if you have any questions just let me know. 

## Philosophy
I also try to keep my `$HOME` as clean as possible and therefor stick to the [XDG-Base-Configuration](https://specification.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html). As a suckless-enthusiast I primarily use software, that follows a minimalistic approach and does the job. Software that comes with alot of external dependencies often tends to be bloated in my eyes, so I try to avoid that and simply stick to something more simplistic (emacs is a good example here).

## Software
This is an uncompleted list of software, that I use on a daily base:
- vis (text editor based on sam)
- dwm (suckless window manager)
- dmenu (suckless launcher)
- dwmblocks (suckless statusbar)
- fzf (fuzzy match finder)
- irssi (IRC client)
- mpd/ncmpcpp (music player)
- mpv (video player)
- ranger/w3m (terminal filemanager)
- sxiv (image viewer)
- tmux (terminal multiplexer)

## Setup
I keep scripts that I find useful in `.local/bin/`. Config files are stored in `.config/`. I am able to source my `bashrc` from there aswell by using the following if-statement in `/etc/bash.bashrc`:
```
if [ -s "$HOME/.config/bash/bashrc" ]; then
  . "$HOME/.config/bash/bashrc"
fi 
```
## Theming and startup
While I enjoy the solarized-light theme, I dislike some of the color choices that come with it. Thats why I made a less colorized version of it. Every information about it is stored in `.config/X11/xressources` and `.config/X11/xinitrc` contains all the necessary programs that get executed once X is started. Imagemagick has some nice options to determine the most prominent colors of certain wallpapers, so I might write something in the near future to automatically pipe those informations to update a theme via `xrdb -m`. 

## Inspiration
* [suckless.org](https://suckless.org) - software that sucks less
* [fsf](https://fsf.org) - Free Software Foundation
* [libreboot](https://libreboot.org) - freedom-respecting boot firmware
* [parabola](https://www.parabola.nu) - free, simple, and lightweight operating system
