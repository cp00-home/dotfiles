# Welcome to my dotfiles

![current desktop](/pictures/desktop.jpg)

Feel free to copy whatever you like from my current setup. I spend some time to make everything look coherent, so if you have any questions just let me know. I also try to keep my *$HOME* as clean as possible and therefor stick to the *XDG-Base-Configuration*. As a suckless-enthusiast I use software, that follows a minimalistic approach. You will find patched versions of it under */documents/sources/*. 
That's all folks - have a good one!
